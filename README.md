# NashvilleHousing- SQL_Data-Cleaning
Data: NashvilleHousing

In this project I took raw housing data and transform it in SQL Server to make it more usable for analysis.

Skill used : UPDATE, ALTER, ROW NUMBER(), SUBSTRING(), PARSENAME(), REPLACE(), MAX(), WITH CTE, CASE ststements, ISNULL(), COUNT(), CONVERT()

Data Cleaning steps:
- Standardize Date Format,
- Breaking out Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State), 
- Change Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field, 
- Remove Duplicates, 
- Delete Unused Columns
